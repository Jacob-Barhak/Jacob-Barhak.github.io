    <body><p><b>Visualizing Intensive Care Unit Data</b><br>The interactive plots below visualize the Intensive Care Unit data of a single patient from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ICU"> UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.The data is shown along a similar time line and provides visual cues for some measurements with many points by applying various filtering techniques. Details about this visualization can be found in the MODSIM paper titled: "Visualization and Pre-Processing of Intensive Care Unit Data Using Python Data Science Tools". The code that generated these plots can be found  <a href="https://github.com/Jacob-Barhak/VisICU"> here</a>. </p>
    <p> The Visualization file is hosted on Github. To visualize it, you will need a fairly strong machine, an active Internet connection, and wait for a minute or two for the file to load and show. You can access the visualization directly using  <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/Jacob-Barhak/VisICU/master/VisualICU.html"> this link</a>. If you experience problems viewing using this link, please download the file VisualICU.html from the Github repository to your computer and launch it in a browser</p>
